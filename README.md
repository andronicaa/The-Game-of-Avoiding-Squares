# The-Game-of-Avoiding-Squares

* Each player inserts in turn his own mark in a free space of the grid, avoiding making a square. The square made by one of the players can be of any size and in any position (parallel or not with Ox and Oy axis). It is clear that game could be finished always. But the draw is possible only on grids less than 7x7.
* The game is made with the WinBGIm graphics library. It can be played on boards from 3x3 to 20x20(player vs player or player vs computer). There are two moder against the computer gema, the easy one in which the computer randomply adds the pieces to the board, and the hard one in which the computer adds the pieces to the board according to a strategy that firs deals with how the first player moved. The computer will move the pieces symmetrically with those moved by the player
* After choosing a language different sound settings can be made, but you also can see a tutorial to understand what are the rules of the game.
